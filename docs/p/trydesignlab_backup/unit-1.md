# Introduction

Everyone wants to be an innovator these days, but coming up with consistently innovative solutions (products that are technically viable, usable, and desirable) is actually pretty hard — especially when we don't think about what our users really want. Our goal in this course is to introduce you to a set of research techniques and processes that you can use on any product you’ll be working on in the future.

This unit will help orient your thinking by introducing you to the product development framework we’ll be using in this course, and give you a birds-eye view of some of the research techniques you’ll be diving into. We’ll help answer some key questions: what is user research, why is it valuable, and how does it fit into the overall design process?

> ## Learning Goals

## Welcome to UX Research & Strategy!

We're really excited to have you here! We want you to make the most out of this course, so here are our top tips before you start:

* **Schedule your first session with your mentor ASAP!** Make sure you schedule your session at least 24 to 48h in advance to make sure your mentor accepts the session request. If you need to cancel at any point, make sure you do so at least 24h in advance. If not, you'll forfeit your session.
* **If you have any mentor issues, let us know!** We consider the mentor experience to be extremely important — the most essential piece of the Designlab course — and we want to make sure it's amazing. So if your mentor isn't responding with feedback to your submissions within 2 days, if you have scheduling difficulties, or anything else - please let us know by sending an email to [hello@trydesignlab.com](mailto:hello@trydesignlab.com) and we'll help you get sorted.
* **Budget approximately 10h per week of work** in order to go through the course smoothly.
* **Read our article: [5 Ways to Get The Most Out Of A Designlab Short Course](http://trydesignlab.com/blog/how-to-get-most-from-designlab-short-course/)** to get even more tips on how you can succeed.


We've had thousands of students go through our courses and add valuable skills to their resume with the unique mix of hands-on work and 1-on-1 mentorship on Designlab.

And now that you're ready for it, let's dive into the course.

**Happy learning!**

## What are products?

We're surrounded by products on an everyday basis. Let's start this course with the very basics, and examine what a "product" is.

## Product Development as a Process

Like we just discussed, we care about creating solutions that respond to the needs and desires of our target consumers, in a way that is usable, pleasing, and memorable. That seems like quite a challenge!

Luckily, we have design. At its finest, design isn’t just a way to make things look nice — it’s a set of tools and frameworks that can help you consistently problem-solve and come up with innovative solutions.

By treating design as a structured process where you’re making sure that you’re solving the right problems at each step, you can ensure consistently better outcomes while preserving your resources of time and money.

So, here's the challenge for UX designers. You start with an **idea** — a hypothesis on a problem customers have, that you can solve. How do you turn that into an end product that people love? There are many different ways to approach this problem... let's take a look at one framework that outlines the process of "Validated Learning". The lecture below will outline the steps of this process.

## Good Design Starts With Research

We just looked at the overall product development process — going from an idea to an end product — and shared some resources on how research fits into the overall UX design cycle. Now, we'll look at an overview of the "Design Thinking" framework we'll be using throughout the course.
