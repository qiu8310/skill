A **product** is a created object (a good, service, or other resource) that provides a benefit to someone (typically a customer or user).

Products create value in their users' lives either by alleviating problems or creating gains.

Early on products were mainly conceived of as physical objects. In the last thirty years, our understanding of "products" has expanded over time to include services, systems, and experiences that help address particular human needs.

In the context of digital design, “product” is typically an application, tool, or site, built to solve user problems.

Products have two inherent qualities that speak to users' needs:

* **Tangible**: e.g., A hat keeps the rain off my head and keeps my head warm
* **Intangible**: e.g., A hat can be a fashion object which connects the user to a social clique, conveys social status, or amplifies the personality of the wearer.

The **tangible** qualities of a product speak to how well the product solves a problem — *how dry does this raincoat keep me? How warm is this jumper?*

**Intangible** qualities often speak to "how" a product solves a problem — the experience of using a product and how it feels. Alternatively, the intangible can speak to the psycho-social aspects of the product — how it makes me feel, and how it positions me amongst my friends, peers, and society.

It's relatively easy to determine what the tangible needs of our users are... but superior products need to understand the intangible needs as well. That's not easy!

The products that jump from just solving *tangible* needs to addressing our *intangible* desires are the ones that deeply speak to their users and their motivations. So, the question arises: how do we better understand our users and what they truly want and need?

The answer is, of course, research! It's a core part of any solid user-centered design process, and you'll be learning all about different research techniques in this course.
