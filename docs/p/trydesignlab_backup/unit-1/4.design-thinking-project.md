# Design Thinking Project

There are many products you use on a daily basis. Think of one product that you love - perhaps your phone or a pair of comfy shoes, and one product that you use regularly that annoys you - maybe it's a camera or a can opener.

Take pictures of each of these products. For each product we'd like you to come up with a list of the tangible and intangible features of the products.
